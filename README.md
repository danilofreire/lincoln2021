> **Abstract**: How does legislature size impact public service provision? Despite the importance of institutional design for democratic governance, the effect of particular legislative features on citizen welfare remains little understood. In this paper, we use a formal model to show that increasing legislature size improves public goods provision. We argue that changes in bargaining costs depend on whether additional legislators share the Executive's party affiliation: More opposition members reduce the Executive's public goods provision, while more government-aligned members increase it. We test this theory by exploiting sharp discontinuities in city council size in Brazil. We show that an additional city councilor has a 91% chance of belonging to the mayoral coalition, and this significantly improves primary school enrollment and infant mortality measures. To explore possible mechanisms, we surveyed former councilors and analyzed 346,553 bills proposed between 2005 and 2008. This paper has implications for the design of representative institutions.
